Fib is a Fireworks plugin that exports Fireworks Pages into a
JSON page description as well as associated images. It is a means of
creating platform independent view descriptions for mobile devices.

The main reason for fib is to streamline app development by having
a true vector graphics program handle view creation and not require
any importing of assets into Interface Builder (or use Interface Builder
at all).

My iOS support for fib exported views will likely come in the form 
of a CocoaPod. I just need to break my code out into a pod.

Fib likely only works as a plugin for fireworks on OS X. 
It has not been used once on Windows, so beware.

You install fib by running the install bash script in this directory.
Presently you have to choose which directory fib will export to when
running the fib command in Fireworks, and that chosen directory must 
contain a "views" and "images" folder. I will need to make that easier.

Also in the bin directory is a bash script, fib_all, that I have Xcode
call each time it builds my project. This checks your art directory
to see if any fireworks source files have changed, then tells Fireworks
to export the files again if there has been a change. This way, I never
have to export manually from Fireworks. This will need some love to make
using this easier.

Massive thanks to Massive Health for saying I could open source this in 2012.

Thanks again!
